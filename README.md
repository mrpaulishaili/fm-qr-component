## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the implication of colors to the aesthtics understanding of a design. I also learnt the simple implementation of Grid, Flexbox and thier differences.

I was also able to implement simple mixins, like this, in SCSS:

```scss
@mixin flex {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will look forward to learning more on mixins and functions and how I can implement on even larger project to make my career as a developer easier.
