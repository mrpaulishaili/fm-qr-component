## Overview

QR-Code-Component, newbie challenge on Frontend challenges. I took this challenge in understanding implementation of css file in html file an intepreting designs to markup language and stylesheet.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learcnt the implication of colors to the aesthtics understanding of a design. I also learnt the simple implementation of Grid, Flexbox and thier differences.

I was also able to implement simple mixins, like this, in SCSS:

```scss
@mixin flex {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I will look forward to learning more on mixins and functions and how I can implement on even larger project to make my career as a developer easier.
